This is a map showing the track layout of the Milwaukee Streetcar.
It shows the relative layout of tracks but is not to scale.

The system is currently under construction and the map will be periodically
updated to reflect new construction. Tracks are added to the map when it
their location can be observed from construction activity.

Contributions
-------------
I will take contributions and suggestions (MRs, but preferably issues). However,
to keep the chronological nature of the map, I will be rewriting history so that commits show the map over time.
